# generate-quiz

This is a PWA web application created some time ago to help me and other students study computer science. I had very little time to make it before my exam so unfortunately it's done in vanilla.js and is missing some functionality such as the usage of history API for routing.

It uses a modified version of my generate-quiz library which I also have made for school purposes. It scores around 100% in all Chrome audits and has all the basic PWA functionality enabled by Workbox.

### Is there something wrong?

Please tell me!
